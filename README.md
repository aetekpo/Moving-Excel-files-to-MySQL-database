## Steps followed in the project
- **Step 1**: The original dataset was downsampled from 555,718 rows to 10,000 rows containing 70% of is_fraud data called subfraudtest.
- **Step 2**: The subfraudtest was split into different Excel sheets corresponding to different tables in MySQL database.
- **Step 3**: The tables in the database were populated with data coming from corresponding Excel sheets using python scripts.
